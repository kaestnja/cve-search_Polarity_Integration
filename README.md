cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search and processing of CVEs.

For more information on setting up your own cve-search database please see [https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search).

By default, the integration will retrieve CVE results from the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) accessible at `https://cve.circl.lu`.

> Note that if you make use of the CIRCL cve-search server then your queries will be logged to help them debug their software and acquire statistics about software vulnerabilities trending.

Please see [https://www.circl.lu/services/cve-search/](https://www.circl.lu/services/cve-search/) for more information.
