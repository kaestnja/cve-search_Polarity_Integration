cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search and processing of CVEs.

For more information on setting up your own cve-search database please see [https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search).

If you would like to try out the integration without setting up your own cve-search server you can use the publically acccessible server hosted by Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg.  To make use of this server you should set the Server URL option to ``.  

> Note that if you make use of the CIRCL cve-search server then your queries will be logged to help them debug their software and acquire statistics about software vulnerabilities trending.
